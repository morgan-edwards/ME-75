## Getting started
1. Enter your name and date of birth, then click the 'Generate Melody' button.'
2. Play with the effects and options to morph the melody.
3. Change the octave using you keyboard's `+` and `-` keys.
4. When the cursor is placed within the bounds of the black melody player, the instrument can be controlled using your keyboard. The keys are mapped as follows:

| Key | Pitch |
| ----|:-----:|
| s   | C|
| e   | C#|
| d|D|
|r|D#|
|f| E|
|g| F|
|y| F#|
|h| G|
|u| G#|
|j| A|
|i| A#|
|k| B|
|l| C|
  

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
- Play my name utilizes the HTML5 Web Audio API and the Tone.js library to generate all sounds during runtime.
- Interactivity is acheived primarily through vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation. JQuery is used occasionally for readability and brevity.
- After the tone is generated by an oscillator, the signal is chained through several user-controled effects.

## Info processing
Musical theory paradigms concerning pitch and rythym are incorporated into algorithms that generate two measures of theoretically logical music. Users' names are used to generate the keys and pitches, while the birthday is used to generate a rythym sequence. This is an example of a function used in this process:
```js
const nameToKey = (string, mode) => {
  const pitches = ["C","C#","D","D#","E","F","F#","G","G#","A","A#","B"];
  let tonic = Math.floor((string[0].charCodeAt() - 96) / 2);
  if (tonic > 12) tonic = 1;
  const steps = (mode === 'minor') ? [2,1,2,2,1,2] : [2,2,1,2,2,2];
  const key = [pitches[tonic]];

  steps.forEach((step) => {
    let prevPitch = key[key.length-1];
    key.push(pitches[(pitches.indexOf(prevPitch) + step) % 12]);
  });
  return key;
};
```
